summary: Facilitating AR authoring for indoor planning.
abstract: "Creating AR scenes is still a complex process and requires the necessary IT skills. The ATLANTIS project aims to develop an authoring tool that can be used by interior designers and sales professionals as well as private users. This is made possible by the use of AI technologies for the automatic determination of the room layout, recognition, and segmentation of objects in the room. With ATLANTIS, users can also visually remove real objects in the scene with the help of the Diminished Reality (DR) technology, for example, to replace them by computer generated objects. In this presentation, we will introduce the use cases targeted by ATLANTIS and initial findings from surveying user requirements. We will present the technical approach taken by ATLANTIS for AR and DR authoring, and also outline open challenges beyond the specific use case."
