abstract = {In the field of 3D Human Performance Capture, a high-quality 3D scan of the performer
is rigged and skinned to an animatable 3D template mesh that is subsequently fitted
to the captured performance's RGB-D data. Template fitting is accomplished via solving
for the template's pose parameters that better explain the performance data at each
recorded frame. In this paper, we challenge open implementations of zeroth-order optimizers
to solve the template fitting problem in a human performance capture dataset. The
objective function that we employ approximates, the otherwise costly to evaluate,
3D RMS hausdorff distance between the animated template and the 3D mesh reconstructed
from the depth data (target mesh) at an individual recorded frame. We distinguish
and benchmark the optimizers, in three different real-world scenarios, two of which
are based on the geometric proximity of the template to the target in individual frames,
while in the third one we fit the template sequentially to all target frames of the
recorded sequence. Conclusions of this work can serve as a reference for future optimizer
implementations and our findings can server as a baseline for future multi-objective
optimization approaches. We make part of our benchmark and experiment setup publicly
available (https://github.com/VCL3D/nevergrad, https://github.com/VCL3D/PerformanceCapture/releases/).},
