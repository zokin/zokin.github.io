5G-MEDIA aims at innovating media-related applications by investigating how these applications and the underlying 5G network should be coupled and interwork to the benefit of both. In this respect, 5G-MEDIA addresses the objectives of 1) capitalizing and properly extending the valuable outcomes of the running 5G PPP projects to offer an agile programming, verification and orchestration platform for services, and 2) developing network functions and applications to be demonstrated in large-scale deployments, based on 3 well-defined use cases (in the areas of immersive media and VR, smart production and user-generated content, and UHD over CDN) of diverse requirements and particular interest for the consortium partners.
